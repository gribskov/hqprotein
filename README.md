## improved protein gene models

Anecdotally it seems that may gene models in complete genomes contain errors 
such as missing exons, included introns, artificial fusion to adjacent genes,
and artificial splitting into multiple predicted genes. Thee is a great deal of 
information that is not included in standard gene models that might be able to detect and correct these errors
