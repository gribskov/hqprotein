## codon
measurements based on codons and codon preference.

### Gribskov plans
1. Get overall codon usage/preference using reference genome and annotation.
2. Some genes in reference annotation may be wrong, so sharpen the frequencies by
raising to a power as is done with Dirichlet prior.
3. Non-anotation based approach?
