## codon
measurements based on codons and codon preference.
* **Codon.py** - Class for managing codon tables
* **codon_model.py** - basic example of average codon usage plot, can see some discrimination

### Gribskov plans
#### Done
1. (260201) Get overall codon usage/preference using reference genome and annotation. see Codon.py
#### To Do
2. Some genes in reference annotation may be wrong, so sharpen the frequencies by
raising to a power as is done with Dirichlet prior.
2. Non-anotation based approach?
